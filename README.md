# telemetry-data-cleaner
Telemetry monitoring is used in hospitals and long-term care facilities to monitor cardiac data of patients for extended periods of time. However, there is no standard for extracting data from monitors and as such, there are various formats that are not always compatible. This project helps clean telemetry data in order to be used for processing and analysis.
