# telemetry-data-cleaner
Telemetry monitoring is used in hospitals and long-term care facilities to monitor cardiac data of patients for extended periods of time. However, there is no standard for extracting data from monitors and as such, there are various formats that are not always compatible. This project helps clean telemetry data in order to be used for processing and analysis.

In this specific case, we are measuring heart rate and respiratory rate from a telemetry device which is being compared to two other devices. The Dozee and EarlySense are non-invasive devices meant for hospice or home use to continually monitor heart rate and respiratory rate of patients while they are in a bed. The devices work without physically touching the patient and are positioned under the mattress.
